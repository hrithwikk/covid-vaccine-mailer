# covid-vaccine-mailer
-Sends a mail of available no of doses at vaccination centers searched on Cowin website.
-This code is written using python, and utilises the Selenium and SMTP library. 
-The selenium part scrapes the vaccination information from https://www.cowin.gov.in, for the added pincode inside the code, and mails the information on a tabular form to a given email id.
-Present version only extracts the information for the current date.
-I made this code to execute only when I do so, however, automation can be done fairly easy using APscheduler or other libraries.
